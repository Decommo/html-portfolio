<h1>THE BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO JI</h1>

<h2>Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Jerry Maguire</h3>
<p>This is the movie I watched 3 times in cinema with my own money and it reminded me what the most important in my life would be. Highly recommended if anyone has not watched it and Tom Cruise looks gorgeious in this movie.</p>

<h3>The Priests (2015)</h3>
<p>This is religious horror movie made in South Korea and it was not really scarely but really fun to watch. Unlike other typical exocism movies, this takes different angle and impressed those actors.</p>

<h3>Dark Knight (2008)</h3>
<p>This is the best Batman movie out of all and Heath Ledger just nailed it as a Joker. I am sorely miss Heath. Must watch if you are action hero movie fan.</p>
